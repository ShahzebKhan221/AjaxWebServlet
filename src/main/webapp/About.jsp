<pre class="about">
	 This project is based on the CRUD i.e. <em>Create, Retrive, Update and Delete</em>. There are some
	 additional function in this one like for the records that are deleted can rejoin and we

	 bar. To check all the available records we can click <em>Available Records</em>.

	 the record.
